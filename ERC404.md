Key features of ERC-404 include:

Hybrid Nature: While ERC-20 focuses on fungible tokens (identical and interchangeable) and ERC-721 on non-fungible (unique and not interchangeable), ERC-404 utilizes both types of token standards, allowing both fungible and non-fungible functionalities within the same smart contract. This functionality is similar to the already existing ERC-1155 standard, which also enables the same type of token operations from a single contract.

Native Fractionalization of NFTs: Unlike standard ERC-721, where an NFT represents a whole, indivisible asset, ERC-404 introduces native support for fractional ownership of NFTs. This means users can own a part of an NFT, enhancing liquidity and accessibility for high-value assets.

Enhanced Liquidity: By allowing fractional ownership, ERC-404 overcomes one of the main limitations of traditional NFTsâ€”their lack of liquidity. It enables smaller investors to participate in the ownership of high-value assets and facilitates easier trading on exchanges.

Dynamic Functionality: ERC-404 tokens can act as either fungible or non-fungible assets depending on the transaction context. For example, when buying or receiving tokens from another user, the contract can automatically allocate ERC-721 NFTs to represent specific ownership rights or achievements while also handling fungible token transactions seamlessly.

ERC-404 Functions:
The ERC-404 introduces a set of functions that allow for the nuanced handling of both fungible and non-fungible token aspects within a single contract. Let's explain each function and component within the ERC-404 contract:

OWNER, SPENDER, AND OPERATOR
Before discussing the functions of the ERC-404 contract, let's define some key terms and roles to avoid confusion:

Owner: The entity or address that holds ownership of the tokens. In the context of NFTs (ERC-721 tokens), the owner possesses a unique token. For fungible tokens (ERC-20), the owner holds a certain quantity of the tokens.

Spender: An address that has been granted permission by the owner to transfer a specified amount of the owner's fungible tokens (ERC-20) or a specific NFT (ERC-721) on their behalf.

Operator: An entity or address given approval by the owner to manage all of their tokens, both fungible and non-fungible. This role is broader than that of a spender, as it can encompass management of all the owner's assets within a contract.

Events:
ERC20Transfer: Emitted when a fungible token transfer occurs.
Approval: Indicates approval of a spender to withdraw tokens on behalf of the owner.
Transfer: Emitted for both ERC-20 and ERC-721 transfers, indicating a token's transfer.
ERC721Approval: Similar to Approval, but specifically for ERC-721 token IDs.
ApprovalForAll: Emitted when an owner approves an operator to manage all their tokens.
Errors:
NotFound: Indicates a query for a non-existent token ID.
AlreadyExists: Thrown if attempting to mint a token with an ID that already exists.
InvalidRecipient: Used when a transfer is attempted to the zero address or an otherwise invalid recipient.
InvalidSender: Thrown if the sender is not authorized or valid.
UnsafeRecipient: Indicates that a recipient contract cannot handle ERC-721 tokens.
Metadata:
name: The name of the token.
symbol: The symbol of the token.
decimals: Used for fungible tokens to define the smallest unit.
totalSupply: The total supply of fungible tokens.
minted: Counter for minted tokens, ensuring unique IDs for NFTs.
Mappings:
balanceOf: Maps an address to its balance of fungible tokens.
allowance: Maps an owner to an operator and the number of tokens they're allowed to spend.
getApproved: Maps a token ID to an approved address for that specific token.
isApprovedForAll: Maps an owner to an operator for approval across all tokens.
\_ownerOf: Internal mapping of token IDs to their owners.
\_owned: Maps an address to an array of token IDs they own.
\_ownedIndex: Keeps track of the index of each token ID in the \_owned array.
whitelist: Maps addresses that are whitelisted from minting or burning tokens.
Constructor:
Initializes the contract with the name, symbol, decimals, total supply of fungible tokens, and the contract owner.

Functions:
setWhitelist: Allows the contract owner to whitelist addresses, preventing them from minting or burning tokens while transferring tokens.
ownerOf: Returns the owner of a specified token ID.
tokenURI: (Abstract Function) Should be implemented to return the URI for a token's metadata.
approve: Allows a token owner to approve another address to spend a specific amount or token ID on their behalf.
setApprovalForAll: Enables or disables approval for an operator to manage all of the caller's tokens.
transferFrom: Facilitates the transfer of fungible tokens or a specific NFT from one address to another.
transfer: Allows for the transfer of fungible tokens from the caller's address to another.
safeTransferFrom (with and without data): Similar to transferFrom but includes checks to ensure the recipient can safely receive NFTs.
\_transfer: Internal function that handles the logic of transferring fungible tokens, including potential minting or burning of NFTs based on the transferred amount.
\_getUnit: Returns the unit used for fractional transfers, typically 10^decimals.
\_mint: Mints a new token ID to a specified address.
\_burn: Burns the specified token ID from a given address.
\_setNameSymbol: Allows updating the token's name and symbol.
